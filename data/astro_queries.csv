"What is the Chandrasekhar limit?","The Chandrasekhar limit is approximately 1.4 solar masses, the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf star. Beyond this limit, electron degeneracy pressure cannot support the star against gravitational collapse, leading to a neutron star or Type Ia supernova.",stellar_evolution,medium,Astrophysics 101,Named after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar who calculated it in 1930
"Explain the significance of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.","The H-R diagram plots stars by luminosity (or absolute magnitude) vs. surface temperature (or spectral class). It reveals distinct groupings — main sequence, giants, supergiants, and white dwarfs — showing how stars evolve over their lifetimes based on mass and composition.",stellar_classification,easy,Stellar Astrophysics,Independently developed by Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell around 1910
"What causes a gamma-ray burst (GRB)?","Long-duration GRBs (>2 seconds) are caused by the collapse of massive stars (collapsars) forming black holes with relativistic jets. Short-duration GRBs (<2 seconds) result from mergers of compact objects like neutron star–neutron star or neutron star–black hole binaries.",high_energy,hard,NASA GRB catalog,GRB 970508 was the first with a measured redshift confirming cosmological origin
"How does gravitational lensing work?","Gravitational lensing occurs when a massive object (galaxy cluster, black hole) curves spacetime, bending light from a background source. Strong lensing produces multiple images or arcs; weak lensing causes subtle shape distortions; microlensing causes temporary brightness magnification.",cosmology,medium,General Relativity texts,Predicted by Einstein in 1915 and first observed during the 1919 solar eclipse
"What is the cosmic microwave background (CMB)?","The CMB is relic thermal radiation from ~380,000 years after the Big Bang when the universe cooled enough for protons and electrons to form neutral hydrogen (recombination). It has a nearly perfect blackbody spectrum at 2.725 K with tiny anisotropies (~1 part in 100,000) that seeded large-scale structure.",cosmology,medium,Planck mission data,Discovered accidentally by Penzias and Wilson in 1965
"Describe the process of nucleosynthesis in stars.","Stellar nucleosynthesis fuses lighter elements into heavier ones. The pp-chain and CNO cycle convert hydrogen to helium on the main sequence. Helium burning (triple-alpha) produces carbon. Successive burning stages in massive stars create O, Ne, Si up to iron. Elements heavier than iron form via s-process (AGB stars) and r-process (supernovae/neutron star mergers).",nuclear_astrophysics,hard,Burbidge et al. B2FH paper,The B2FH paper (1957) laid the foundation for stellar nucleosynthesis theory
"What is dark energy and what evidence supports it?","Dark energy is a mysterious component (~68% of the universe's energy density) driving accelerated cosmic expansion. Evidence includes Type Ia supernovae distance measurements (1998 discovery), CMB anisotropy patterns, and baryon acoustic oscillation surveys. The simplest model is a cosmological constant (Lambda) with equation of state w = -1.",cosmology,hard,Supernova Cosmology Project,Saul Perlmutter and Brian Schmidt shared the 2011 Nobel Prize for this discovery
"What are magnetars and how do they differ from regular pulsars?","Magnetars are neutron stars with extreme magnetic fields (~10^14 to 10^15 Gauss), roughly 1000x stronger than typical pulsars. They emit powerful X-ray and gamma-ray bursts powered by magnetic field decay rather than rotation. They have longer spin periods (2-12 seconds) and spin down rapidly compared to rotation-powered pulsars.",compact_objects,medium,McGill Magnetar Catalog,Only about 30 confirmed magnetars are known as of 2024
"Explain the Tully-Fisher relation and its use in cosmology.","The Tully-Fisher relation is an empirical correlation between a spiral galaxy's intrinsic luminosity and its rotational velocity (measured via the width of the 21 cm hydrogen line). Faster-rotating galaxies are more luminous. It serves as a distance indicator: comparing observed brightness with TF-predicted luminosity yields distance, used to measure the Hubble constant.",extragalactic,medium,Tully & Fisher 1977,The baryonic Tully-Fisher relation extends this to include gas mass
"What is the Eddington luminosity and why does it matter?","The Eddington luminosity is the maximum luminosity a body can achieve where radiation pressure outward balances gravitational force inward. For a star of mass M: L_Edd ≈ 3.2 × 10^4 (M/M_sun) L_sun. It sets an upper limit on accretion rates onto compact objects and explains why supermassive black holes have maximum growth rates.",accretion_physics,hard,Eddington 1926,Super-Eddington accretion is possible with photon trapping in thick disks
